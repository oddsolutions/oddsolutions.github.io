## `whoami`

My name is Nolen Johnson, I'm a Hardware/OT Security Consultant at [DirectDefense, Inc.](https://www.directdefense.com/) I am the Hardware SME in their [Connected System's](https://www.directdefense.com/services/connected-systems/) division, which focuses on Product Security, SCADA/OT/IoT/IIoT enviorment security, and compliance services.

I'm originally from Saint Augustine, FL, but currently reside in Orlando, FL.

I really enjoy hardware hacking/exploration on any IoT/Android device I can get my hands on. Sometimes cool things come out of my research, other times there's nothing much to see. I love collaborating with other researchers, if you have something you'd like to work with me on, don't hesitate to reach out!

I will be posting a few main types of content here:

* Exploit Releases - Self-developed vulnerabillities outlined in research papers, often including POC exploits.
* Exploit Writeups - Externally-developed exploits disected in research papers.
* Research Papers - My personal research that didn't result in full exploit releases for some reason or another, but may be useful to others!
* Tech Tips - Random things I come across along the way, such as how to dump specific firmwares, disect specific, file-types, etc.
