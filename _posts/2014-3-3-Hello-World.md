## `whoami`

My name is Nolen Johnson, I'm a OT/Hardware Security Consultant at the cyber-security firm [Stroz Friedberg, a LevelBlue company](https://levelblue.com/consulting-and-professional-services), formerly Aon Cyber Solutions..

I developed methodologies, processes, offerings, marketing materials, sales battlecards, and many other components to launch the division, and currently lead the Hardware Security practice.

Previously, I spent 5 wonderful years at [DirectDefense, Inc](https://www.directdefense.com/) helping get the [Connected Systems](https://www.directdefense.com/services/connected-systems/) division off the ground. Connected Systems focused on hardware security, OT/SCADA/ICS enviorment security, and firmware security.

I'm originally from Burnsville, MN, but currently live in Orlando, FL.

I am very passionate about hardware hacking, and security research on IoT and mobile devices. Sometimes cool things come out of my research, other times I just write up a narrative of the various things I tried on a device.

I will be posting 4 main types of content here:

* Vulnerabillity research and disclosure narratives with accompanying exploit releases
* Open ended research papers, usually vulnerability research that didn't pan out
* My thoughts on, breakdowns of, and findings related to public exploits
* Random how-to's/educational writeups
